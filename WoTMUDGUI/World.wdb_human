    <heading> Outside the Sturdy Gates</heading>
    <description>Stands of black elder and sourgum give way to a well-cobbled path headingwest into the city. Robust gates of bronze and a stalwart portcullis barpassage through the imposing gatehouse, its stones pitted by years of rainand exposure to the weather. On the side of the road, fragile stalks ofyellow broomweed sprout between the cobblestones.</description>

    <description>A two story high bronze gate and portcullis is set into the wallsurrounding the city, its sheer size a testament to how quickly troopmovement could occur if the city was threatened. Set above the gate areseveral murder holes for siege defense. Mar Rouis Way runs south to north,and Comelle Street is to the west.</description>

    <description>An oasis of miniature streams and waterfalls interlaced with greenery, thispark within the city is canopied with trees that flower throughout theyear. A large wall to the north and east provides a boundary betweencivilization and the wilds. Shorelle Boulevard leads to the west, and MarRouis Way is a straight line southward. Mounted on the oil lamp's post area dull gleaming plaque and a sign.</description>

A tall and ancient-looking wall bisected by a thick iron gateis the boundary for the city to the north. Upon the gate is emblazoned asigil that looks weathered by the Ages. Lining the road to the south arebuildings that stand so closely together that it would be hard for a cat toslink between them. A blur of dark green to the west could be a stand oftrees, perhaps a park.</description>

    <description>The southernmost road in the city is narrow, with such close quarters thatit's as if the street was an afterthought when the city was built. The wallsurrounding the city looms to the south offering protection againstanything that could be roaming beyond them. To the east is a park, and tothe west the street is a straight line of shops and houses.</description>

    <heading> A Pond Beneath the Branches</heading>
    <description>Stands of alder and oak thrust from the loamy soil tall and proud asspears, their leaves spread like hands to catch the rain. The streamtrickling in from the east has gathered in a basin of shattered graniteshards, chunks of the rocky outcropping above that have plummeted to thebase of the valley and blocked the stream. The water continues, albeit at amuch slower pace, beneath the stones.</description>

    <description>Tangled knots of chokevine and blackthorn are trampled into the banks ofthe stream that trickles through the base of the valley. Tiny white flowerslitter the muddy ground, chopped and churned by the hooves of the creaturesthat drink from the brook. The water meanders to the west, tumbling overstones of all shapes and hue. Moss covered rocks protrude rudely from thecenter of the stream, beckoning the feet of the unwary.</description>

One of the mounds has recently been ravaged by ananteater, judging by the gaping hole in the side of one of the shafts.Repairs are already underway though, as hundreds of termites swarm alongthe edges of the hole - each of them adding a tiny glob of red earth.</description>

    <heading> The Pale Tree Trunk</heading>
    <description>The dry and brittle trunk of a tree lays here, moisture and life long gonefrom its wood. Its bark has disappeared, leaving only the pale whitecentre. The surface is covered with hundreds of small curls and shallowholes, but the insects who made them are long gone.</description>

    <description>Patches of red earth emerge from the grass and bushes. During rainfalls thepatches doubtlessly hold tiny pools of water - a most welcome relief on theplains. At the moment the water has dried away completely, leavinghard-packed, cracked clay. The road to the west looks much the same.</description>

At each breath of wind, a myriad of hairy particles whirl into theair, ready to test their luck in an area further away. Some of the podshaven't gotten far though. The soggy red earth around the flowers almostlooks furry from the carpet of fluffy seeds stuck onto it.</description>

    <description>A basic fence of wire and wood blocks passage to the east, keeping animalsand people from walking across frail areas of the mine roof. A large earthand gravel deposit lies to the west, no doubt gathered from the dig site.The road tilts slightly downwards to the north, while creating a junctionto the south. Every now and then, the ground trembles slightly.</description>

    <description>Tall, green grass stands on the eastern side of the road, swaying gently inthe wind. A mountain side looms above to the southwest, forcing the pathto make a slight detour. While the road consists mostly of red earth to thesouth, it shifts more towards gravel and rocks to the west.</description>

    <description>The mountain range rises abruptly to the west, dark rock with white, snowycollars. A chilly breeze follows the pass to the west down themountainside, making this area cooler than the rest of the plains. The roadis blocked up into the pass and east around the foot of a mountain. Atrickle of a stream follows the gutter of the road.</description>
